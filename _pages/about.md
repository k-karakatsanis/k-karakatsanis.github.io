I am a cybersecurity professional 
with a strong background in both research and engineering.
I hold an MS in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.gatech.edu/) 
from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) 
and a BS in [Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/dmst) 
from the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr).
My research focuses on computer security, 
particularly static analysis, reverse engineering, and vulnerability detection.

At Georgia Tech, I served as the instructor for the Introduction to Computer Security class.
I also led research projects in firmware reverse engineering and email security 
while working on malware analysis projects.
My work includes 
developing static analysis tools for identifying security vulnerabilities and 
implementing large-scale systems for collecting and analyzing publicly available data.
